## we construct a simple command using basic part of a query. We select specif column from the cycle_hire table, such as end_station_name column


SELECT 

   end_station_name

 FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` ;
 
 
 
 ##After running the first basic query, try answering a specific question about the data. For example, what were the rental_ids for all bike trips that lasted for 20 minutes or longer?

SELECT 

count(*) AS num_of_trips
   

FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire


## we add a filter where clause

WHERE  

  duration >= 1200;
  
  
  #some challenge questions, 
  
  ## f youâ€™re comfortable using queries to answer questions, try creating and running queries to answer any of the questions below: 

##What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from?

##How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"?

##What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?

## What is the name of the station whose ID is 111?

##  How many bike_ids had trip durations greater than 2400 seconds (or 40 minutes)?
 
 
#question: what are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from? 

SELECT 

 bike_id, start_station_name

FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire

WHERE  
    bike_id = 1710;
    
## How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"?
SELECT 

   bike_id,end_station_name, 

FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire

WHERE 
   end_station_name = "Moor Street, Soho";
 
 
## What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?

 SELECT 

 start_station_id, start_station_name,

  

FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire

WHERE 
   start_station_name = 'Canton Street, Poplar';
   
  
##What is the name of the station whose ID is 111?  
  
  SELECT 

 start_station_id, start_station_name,

  

FROM bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire

WHERE 
  start_station_id = 111;
